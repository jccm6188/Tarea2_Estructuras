# MESI
This program is a simulator of a MESI cache coherence protocol, which is intended to learn a little bit more about this protocol. In this program simulates a 2 processor units, each one with its own local cache, and twice with a main cache memory.
The program no need a initial values to work, the user only have to click twice and the program starts the protocol, the rounded time of execution are near to one minute, but that are relative of the computer.
The program put in screen the last 25 data, specifically the main counter, the complete direction of the data and the action that have to make the processor the processor with the control, the state of the data in the caches and the current tag of the data in the caches.

For make run the program first you have to copy the archive named "aligned.trace" (download from the link given below  http://ie0521.jsdanielh.org/memory-tracegcc.trace.gz) in the main direction of de local disk C, if you want to run from another direction, you have to go to the 69 line of the code and change it.
